# TSC-80 - TypeScript for the TIC-80

![Maintenance](https://img.shields.io/maintenance/yes/2023)

![](logo.png)

Write your [TIC-80](https://tic80.com/) **PRO** games in TypeScript.

TSC-80 contains all the functions declarations (`.d.ts`) for the TIC-80 API, and will compile your TypeScript code in JavaScript to inject it into your TIC-80 cart.

## Installation and usage

### Pre-requisites

This tool has been tested with TIC-80 version 1.0.x-dev (pro edition) on Windows 10, and should work on all platforms compatible with TIC-80 and TypeScript.

1. Install NodeJS LTS
2. Install TypeScript: `npm install -g typescript`
3. Install TSC-80: `npm install -g tic80-typescript`

### Create a project

1. `tsc80 init` will create the necessary files (config, declarations, and game files) into the current directory
2. Set the correct values inside the `tsc80-config.json`

### Configuration

You need to complete the `tsc80-config.json` for each project.

```js
{
  "tic": {
    "ticExecutable": "path/to/tic/executable/file", // The file path to your TIC executable.
  },
  "compression": { // These settings will alter how the final js file will look like
    "compressedFile": "build/compressed.js", // Path to compressed file. You should not have to change this.
    "indentLevel": 1, // Ignored if `compress` or `mangle` are `true`
    "compress": false,
    "mangle": false // Compress a bit further
  }
}
```

### Run TSC-80

- `$ tsc80 build` will build your game into the "build" directory
- `$ tsc80 run` will build, watch the changes, and launch your game through TIC-80

Once that TIC-80 is running, all code changes in .ts files will be reflected after a reload (`ctrl+r`). You can update and save your assets directly in TIC-80.

### Workflow

`$ tsc80 run` continuously watches changes in your .ts files and compiles them on the fly. You then alt-tab to TIC-80, and hit `ctrl+r` to reload the game.
This instructs TIC-80 to load `game.js` and inject the compiled code inside the cart.

❗ You must **not** edit the compiled JavaScript code inside the TIC-80 editor. Your changes would be overwritten.  

You must only edit **assets** (sprites, map, sounds, music) inside the TIC-80 editor. Don't forget to save your changes _before_ reloading the code.

When you hit `ctrl+s` inside TIC-80, the `game.js` is updated as a standalone TIC-80 cart.

#### Version control

The `build` folder can be ignored, but you should definitely commit `game.js`, since it contains all non-code assets. `game.js` also contains the compiled code, which is useless for version control, but cannot be separated from the assets.

## Compression options

The compression options in `tsc80-config.json` can help you to save a lot of space if you're running against TIC-80 limitations.

- Default compiled file, straight from TypeScript: 100% of code size
- `"indentLevel": 1` - 71% of original code size (that is the default)
- `"compress": true` - 55%
- `"mangle": true` - 44%

(Your mileage may vary.)

## Code organization & limitations

_**See [this issue](https://github.com/scambier/tic80-typescript/issues/9) for a clear example on how to organize your code.**_

`tsc80 build|run` only transpiles your TypeScript files to JavaScript, and compiles them together as a single output file. Internally, TIC-80 uses [Duktape](https://duktape.org/) as its JavaScript engine.

The following limitations apply:

- ES5 only (with some syntax exceptions). This tool does not provide polyfills.
- Required to have a single file output (`compilerOptions.outFile` in `tsconfig.json`)
- No modules, and no npm dependencies.
- All declared variables and classes at file level (in all files) are public and share the same root namespace.
- By default, files are compiled in an undefined order. This may cause problems, as some initialization code may be called before all the required classes/functions are read, leading to `undefined` errors.

Some tips to ease development:

- You can always use [TypeScript's triple-slash directives](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/triple-slash-directives.html) and [namespaces](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/namespaces.html) to manage dependencies order.
- Don't compress the output file unless necessary; it will be harder to locate and fix runtime errors.

## Issues

**TIC-80 doesn't reload my code**

If you're building TIC-80 yourself, make sure to use the correct settings

```sh
$ cd <path-to-tic>/build
$ cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -DBUILD_PRO=On -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel ..
$ cmake --build . --config MinSizeRel --parallel
```
